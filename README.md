# deep-learning
This repository is from a deep learning class at Middlebury College. The course covered the foundations of deep learning and helped build an intuitive understanding for why it works by understanding the mathematical underpinnings. 
Pairing lectures with labs, we developed cutting-edge deep learning solutions to a variety of real-world problems. 
Topics included neural networks, convolutional networks designed for object detection, and recurrent networks used for natural language processing, transformers, reinforcement learning, and generative adversarial networks.
For a final project, I made a diffusion model that generated new landscapes.
